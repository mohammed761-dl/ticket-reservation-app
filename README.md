# TicketReservationApp

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.10.

## Project Overview

**Automatisation des Systèmes de Réservation de Billets**

### Objective:

In this workshop, you will develop an Angular 19 application capable of functioning offline. This application will allow users to book tickets and store the data locally using IndexedDB, managed via the Dexie.js library. You will also add Tailwind CSS to design a modern and responsive user interface.

### Features:

- **Ticket Reservation Form**: Allows users to input reservation details.
- **View Reservations**: Displays a list of all reservations stored in IndexedDB.
- **Cancel Reservations**: Functionality to cancel a reservation.
- **Offline Functionality**: The app works offline with local storage using IndexedDB and Dexie.js.
- **Modern UI**: Designed using Tailwind CSS for a responsive interface.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200/. 
The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding
Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```
ng generate component component-name
```
For a complete list of available schematics (such as components, directives, or pipes), run:

```
ng generate --help
```
## Building
To build the project run:

```
ng build
```
This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the dist/ directory.
By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests
To execute unit tests with the Karma test runner, use the following command:

```
ng test
```
## Running end-to-end tests
For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```
ng e2e
```
Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
